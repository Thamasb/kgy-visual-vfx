    <!--Introduction-->
    <section class="home">
        <div class="about-me">
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am Gyula, a professional video editor and VFX artist with over 20 years of experience in the
                industry. I specialize in compositing, video retouching, and basic animation, as well as 3D modeling
                and
                VFX supervising. I have been providing freelance VFX services on Fiverr for the past 3 years and am
                a
                Top Rated seller with a 5.0 rating. I am known for my quick and efficient communication and my top
                priority is always to satisfy my clients' needs. Thank you for considering me for your VFX needs. I
                look
                forward to working with you and helping bring your project to the next level.<br>
                What does VFX artist do?
                VFX artists create photoreal, digitally-generated imagery. The role requires the seamless
                integration of these effects into live action in feature films, television and, increasingly, online
                and console gaming. You'll use the latest technology to produce computer-generated creatures, crowds
                and other digital assets.
